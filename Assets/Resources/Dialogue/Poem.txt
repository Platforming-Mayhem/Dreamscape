I sit there alone in the darkness
Scared of what's to come
They told me to run and hide 
so i did 
And sung the song my mum once sang
I look at all the birds flying free in the sky
Wishing that was me
Instead i'm stuck here 
In a place where I don't want to be
With the loud bangs 
rapid shooting 
And the screaming in the background 
Of the young boys that they have been recruiting for the battle ground
But I stop and think, do they know what they are doing?
How many people are we actually losing?
Do they not know everything comes with a price?
And why do they forget all our basic human rights?
So Is it really worth ruining lives 
Everyone's life including mine.
